# Transportation and Food Deserts

Created as part of Cal Civic Hacks Ideathon 2021, our team:
- addressed the issue of urban deserts through the means of public transportation to improve resilience in the movement of people and goods in the Bay Area
- researched and visualized the relationship between lack of bus transits and lack of mobility that leads to food deserts in low-income regions
- developed an idea for legislative reform with supporting case studies and a funding plan
